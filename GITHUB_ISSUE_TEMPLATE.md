# Implement Industry Standard Practices for Go Open Source Project

## üéØ Objective
Transform this repository to meet industry standards for Go open source projects, improving maintainability, security, developer experience, and community adoption.

## üìã Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- Well-structured Go code with clean interfaces
- Comprehensive integration tests using testcontainers
- Good documentation in README and CODEBASE_OVERVIEW
- Proper licensing (LGPL 2.1)
- Basic GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Code is properly formatted and passes `go vet`
- All tests are passing
- Uses modern Go practices (Go 1.23)

### ‚ùå Missing Industry Standards

## üîß Required Improvements

### 1. Repository Infrastructure (High Priority)
- [ ] **Add `.gitignore`** - Go-specific exclusions for build artifacts, IDE files, etc.
- [ ] **Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Contribution guidelines for developers
- [ ] **Add `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** - Community standards and behavior expectations
- [ ] **Create `SECURITY.md`** - Security vulnerability reporting guidelines
- [ ] **Add `Makefile`** - Standardized build, test, and development commands

### 2. Code Quality & Linting (High Priority)
- [ ] **Add `.golangci.yml`** - Comprehensive linting configuration
- [ ] **Enhance GitHub Actions** - Add linting, security scanning, Go version matrix
- [ ] **Add pre-commit hooks** - Ensure code quality before commits
- [ ] **Static security analysis** - CodeQL and security scanning

### 3. Testing & Coverage (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Unit tests for all packages** - Currently only integration tests exist
  - [ ] `configs/` package tests
  - [ ] `impl/` package tests  
  - [ ] `notifs/` package tests
  - [ ] `types/` package tests
- [ ] **Benchmark tests** - Performance monitoring and regression detection
- [ ] **Improve test coverage reporting** - Coverage badges and detailed reports
- [ ] **Test utilities** - Helper functions for testing

### 4. Documentation & Examples (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Enhanced README** - Better examples, API documentation, usage patterns
- [ ] **Examples directory** - Real-world usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] **API documentation** - Comprehensive godoc comments
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide** - Common issues and solutions
- [ ] **Architecture documentation** - System design and flow diagrams

### 5. Development Experience (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Docker support** - Dockerfile and docker-compose for development
- [ ] **Development scripts** - Setup and utility scripts
- [ ] **VS Code configuration** - Workspace settings and recommended extensions
- [ ] **GitHub issue templates** - Bug report and feature request templates
- [ ] **Pull request template** - Standardized PR format

### 6. Security & Maintenance (High Priority)
- [ ] **Dependabot configuration** - Automated dependency updates
- [ ] **Security scanning** - Vulnerability detection in dependencies
- [ ] **Branch protection rules** - Require reviews and status checks
- [ ] **Secret scanning** - Prevent accidental secret commits

### 7. Release Management (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Automated releases** - Semantic versioning and changelog generation
- [ ] **Release notes automation** - Generate release notes from commits
- [ ] **Multi-platform builds** - Support for different OS/architectures
- [ ] **Package publishing** - Automated publishing to Go module proxy

## üöÄ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Repository infrastructure files
2. Basic linting and CI/CD improvements
3. Security scanning setup

### Phase 2: Quality (Week 2)
1. Unit tests for all packages
2. Enhanced documentation
